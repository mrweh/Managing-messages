# Managing-messages
It is a test-task. I need to create 3 blocks.  
1. Rolling messages from second block and you can set "x", that means chosen messages will never be showed. 
2. In a block will be showed all messages in pushed order with their "x" status. 
3. Input text and admit it into second block.
